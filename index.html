        <p class="text-base mt-7 font-arial pl-5 pr-7">Hallo, introduce my name is Fawwaz Thoerif (AkasakaID) and I am a ?? ,I don't know what I am, am I a software engineer, backend developer, or what? . and I live in central Java, Indonesia.</p>
        <p class="text-base mt-3 font-arial pl-5 pr-7">I can speak Indonesian, Javanese, English (poor), Japanese (poor)</p>
        <p class="text-base mt-3 font-arial pl-5 pr-7">Basically I created a program to help me solve problems or make it easier for me to do things. For example, I created a telegram bot to download videos from Tiktok without watermark (<a class="text-blue-500 underline" href="https://github.com/akasakaid/TiktokDownloader" target="_blank">https://github.com/akasakaid/TiktokDownloader</a>) to make it easier for me to download the videos I found on the tiktok application.For another example, I created a program to mensorting files based on their extension (<a class="text-blue-500 underline" href="https://github.com/akasakaid/File-Sorting" target="_blank">https://github.com/akasakaid/File-Sorting</a>) this makes it easier for me to organize the files I have.</p>
        <p class="text-base mt-3 font-arial pl-5 pr-7">I love anime, I enjoy programming even though it's not very good. I love the internet because being on the internet teaches me a lot of things that I can't necessarily get, if I can go back in time, I want to learn more with the internet.</p>
        <p class="text-xl font-bold mt-3 font-arial pl-5">My skill ? </p>
        <p class="text-base mt-1 font-arial pl-7 pr-7"><span class="font-bold">Python</span> I know a lot of programming languages ,but only 1 I use often, which is python. I have started learning since 1 year ago, although there are not many modules that I use.</p>
        <p class="text-base mt-1 font-arial pl-7 pr-7"><span class="font-bold">PHP</span> lately I learned this programming language, because PHP is one of the program languages for developing websites, but I am not yet proficient in using it.</p>
        <p class="text-base mt-1 font-arial pl-7 pr-7"><span class="font-bold">Laravel</span> Lately I have also learned laravel, because laravel itself is a framework from php that is used to develop websites. Although I only understand the concept of the Laravel MVC. Like PHP, I'm also less adept at using Laravel.</p>
        <p class="text-base mt-1 font-arial pl-7 pr-7"><span class="font-bold">Bootstrap</span> I think Bootstrap is the easiest framework for css to use, people who are just starting to learn can definitely use it right away, because it's easy. Although you have to look at the documentation hahaha.</p>
        <p class="text-base mt-1 font-arial pl-7 pr-7"><span class="font-bold">Tailwind</span> Just like bootstrap tailwind is a framework for css, but I think tailwind is a little harder to use, I created this website page using tailwind.</p>
        <p class="text-base mt-1 font-arial pl-7 pr-7"><span class="font-bold">MYSQL</span> yes I know mysql in short mysql is a database, although I only know how to create, read, update and delete (crud)</p>
        <!-- <p class="text-base mt-1 font-arial pl-7 pr-7"><span class="font-bold">Tailwind</span> </p> -->
        <p class="text-base mt-1 font-arial pl-7 pr-7"></p>
